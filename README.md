What it is
----------

A SaaS platform to track and log employee working hours and turn them into beautiful and easily readable reports.

Background
----------

My first client was an owner of a construction company with close to 15 employees and growing. The company has many construction locations they attend daily. Working time and length differ for each location.

Before the app the employees used pen and a formatted sheet of paper to write their daily working hours. Then at the end of the month they all delivered their sheets to their boss.

Problem
-------

For the employer to extract and calculate all the working hour data from his employees takes a great lot of time and effort. Often even a whole weekend just for this single task.

That is where the time log & reporting app comes into the play.

Features
--------

*   Employee Time registering
*   Reporting
*   Employee time entry management
*   User and Project data editing

Challenges
----------

### Whole user experience

*   The app has to be simple enough so a non-technology-inclined people can easily use it
*   Focused on mobile but also for desktop usage

Tehnical Challanges
-------------------

*   Getting print preview work correctly
*   Cutting worker data entries in correct places
*   Showing header and footer for every page
